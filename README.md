# Lab 30: Break It Down
##### April 20, 2020
---

Today we want to emphasize how to break down a larger problem into smaller pieces and to detail and plan out what is needed and necessary for each piece. You can work either on your own or with a partner of your choosing today, but there will not actually be any coding happening! Learning objectives will focus on:
- [ ] Describing in detail the desired goals of a program
- [ ] Breaking a project into smaller pieces
- [ ] Detailing what is required of each smaller piece and how they fit together
- [ ] Coming up with several tests that could be written for each piece to ensure they are working properly.

Again, you have the option of pairs or working solo. Feel free to write up your answers to the below questions in whatever form you want and add the pdf to the Github repository, or you can just edit the provided markdown file in plain text. Whichever you find easier and are more comfortable with.

## Instructions
Suppose you wanted to write a game that will allow two players to play a single round of tic-tac-toe.

#### Part A)
Come up with 4 or more goals for how you could envision this program coming together. Or, to put it differently, what are the fundamental basics to have a reasonable tic-tac-toe game? Those are are the essential goals you have to implement.

#### Part B)
How would you go about breaking this project up into pieces? Identify how all the pieces would fit together and then, for each piece, provide some details on how you'd go about implementing it. Would a class be more appropriate or a series of functions? What inputs would you need? What outputs would you need to provide or what getter and setter methods would you need to give access to? You don't have to actually write the code to do any of this, but you need to write out the basic overall details.

#### Part C)
For _each piece_, come up with 1-2 tests that you could write which would check and guarantee that the code for that piece is functioning properly. Remember that you don't always need to check for confirmations, sometimes it is important to check to make sure your code handles failing conditions appropriately as well!
